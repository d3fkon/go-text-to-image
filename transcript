So my wife left her phone in the bathroom a few days ago
---
and I saw it as I got out of the shower, so I did what any
---
dumbass husband would do, I took ridiculously
---
cheesy nude photos of myself around the house.
---
Nothing sexual or anything. Just things like me
---
eating cereal with my diving hood on and legs spread
---
eagle for no reason, or me watering the plants willst
---
my legs were unnecessarily too far apart and so on.We
---
don’t really go out much and we have no friends in
---
this country (we just moved), so I thought she’d
---
find it really funny when she came home.Well, I went
---
to work and forgot all about it completely. Fast
---
forward to today. We’re at H&M and trying to pay. My
---
wife uses this member thing (I don’t really know
---
exactly what it is. I guess you could be an H&M member
---
or something) that’s on an app on her phone and for
---
some reason, the barcode just won’t scan! 2 people
---
at the counter are trying everything possible. No
---
luck. My wife gets the clever idea that maybe she
---
should take a screenshot of the barcode, zoom in and
---
enlarge it. Maybe it will work then.By this point,
---
there’s a bit of a queue behind us, and the 2nd
---
cashier has to give up and start getting this under
---
control. He’s ringing up the lady next to us. Her
---
kid’s basically watching our cashier basically
---
frantically try to find some sort of solution whilst
---
staring at my wife’s screen, and when my wife opens
---
her photos, well, 20 incredibly unflattering naked
---
photos of myself popped up, the cashier gasps loudly
---
says “oh my god!”, and this little fucking kid
---
shouts “he is naked mommy! That man is naked!!!”
---
My wife’s a fucking tomato , a group of teenage
---
girls behind us burst out laughing at the whole
---
situation and my pits began sweating in ways I never
---
knew my body was capable of.Anyway, my wife didn’t
---
find those pictures as funny as she would’ve at
---
home*, I scarred a child and won’t ever be going
---
back to that particular branch ever again.I should
---
be asleep, but I keep thinking about this and audibly
---
groaning. Probably the most embarrassing thing
---
that’s ever happened to me.Oh and we couldn’t
---
find a solution about the app thing. She told my wife
---
to do something online, but I was so embarrassed my
---
brain shut off.
